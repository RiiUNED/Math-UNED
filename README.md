# Math-UNED – Educational Turn-Based Game in Unity

**Math-UNED** is an educational multiplayer game developed in Unity to help students practice and reinforce multiplication tables through interactive and competitive gameplay. It is part of a final undergraduate project and includes both client and server components.

## Project Goals

- Provide an engaging way to practice multiplication tables.
- Support 1v1 online multiplayer using a turn-based system.
- Encourage learning through repetition and friendly competition.
- Apply software engineering principles using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and unit testing.

## Features

- Multiplication challenges with fixed or random tables  
- Turn-based multiplayer mode (in development)  
- Online gameplay via a custom PHP server  
- Two-player match structure  
- No scoring system – progress is tracked by correct answers  
- Full unit test coverage of core components

## Technology Stack

- Unity (C#) – Game client and interface logic  
- PHP – Server-side logic for turn coordination and matchmaking  
- NUnit – Unit testing framework for gameplay logic

## Academic Context

Math-UNED is being developed as part of a Bachelor’s Degree Final Project. It combines educational objectives with game mechanics and a custom online architecture to demonstrate both technical and pedagogical effectiveness.

## Current Status

Implemented:
- Core single-player functionality
- MVC design pattern
- Comprehensive unit tests

Planned:
- PHP server for multiplayer management
- Matchmaking and turn control
- Real-time 1v1 networked gameplay

## License

This project is intended for academic use. A license will be added upon final submission.
